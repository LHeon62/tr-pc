        <h2>Collect Thoughts</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            This screen is used to enter all your current thoughts. It should be 
            empty most of the time: initially and every time after you have processed 
            all pending thoughts. Thoughts are classified by Topics. The order you 
            enter thoughts is not important, but it may help to enter them by Topic 
            to ensure you cover everything. 
        </p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The data in this screen is displayed in a table. To navigate between 
            rows, you can use the mouse or the arrows keys. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The thoughts are ordered as you have entered them, with the first 
            thought at the top of the list.
        </p>
        <h3>Thoughts entry</h3>
        <p>
            Enter a new thought using the <i>Add Thought</i> button or the F6 key. 
            The Add Thought window is open where the description, topic and notes 
            can be entered.             
        </p>
        <p>
            To enter multiple thoughts, keep on pressing Enter (default button is 
            OK) or press the OK button. The window&#39;s entry is saved and the next 
            thought can be entered. The last Topic used is kept between thought 
            entries. To quit the window, press either the Cancel button or the Esc 
            key.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can call this window from anywhere in the application by using the 
            F6 key.
