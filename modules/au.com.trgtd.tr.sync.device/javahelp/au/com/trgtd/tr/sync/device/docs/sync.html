        <h2>Android Sync Preferences</h2>
        The following preferences can be changed for Android device synchronization.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Sync with Android devices</b> Allows you to specify whether 
                data synchronization with Android devices should be attempted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>WiFi Port</b> Allows you to specify the TCP port used for WiFi synchronization.<br>
                The port number must be between 49152 and 65535 (defaults to 64641). <br>
                It should not normally need to be changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>USB Port</b> Allows you to specify the TCP port used for USB synchronization.<br>
                The port number must be between 49152 and 65535 (defaults to 64642). <br>
                It should not normally need to be changed. If you do change it, be sure to also change
                the setting in the Android application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>ADB Program</b> Allows you to enter the file system path to the ADB program executable.
                Alternatively you can use the "Browse" button to find it. <br><br>
                To synchronize using USB you need to have an executable ADB (Android Debug Bridge) program 
                on your computer and referenced in this field. <br><br>
                This field should default to the ADB program provided. However this may not be executable or have
                sufficient user privileges. If this is the case you will need to do one of the following: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>set this program file as executable for your user account. </li>
                    <li>download and install the <A href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html'>Android SDK</A> 
                        and set this field to the adb (or adb.exe) file in the platform-tools folder of the installation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
