        <h2>Data Preferences</h2>
        The following preferences can be changed for data:

        <h4>Automatic Save</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Automatic save interval:</b> you can specify how often your data is automatically saved.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Data Recovery</h4>
        Every time your data is saved a copy of the data file is first saved as a new recovery file. Your data can then be
        restored if your data file is damaged or lost.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Recovery file folder: </b> enter or use the browse button to locate the system folder for the recovery files.
                Leaving this blank will cause recovery files to be saved in the same folder as the data file.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cleanup options:</b> choose to keep all recovery files or specify a number of recovery files to keep (minimum two).
                The recovery file cleanup is done when ThinkingRock starts and at intervals of one hour.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Backup</h4>
        You can also choose to have automatic backup copies of your data file made periodically.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Backup every:</b> choose how often a backup copy is made (at every startup or day, week, etc, interval) or whether you don't want backups to be made (never).
            </li>
            <li><b>Cleanup options:</b>  choose to keep all backup files or specify a number of backup files to keep (minimum two).
            The backup file cleanup is done when ThinkingRock starts.</li>
        </ul>
