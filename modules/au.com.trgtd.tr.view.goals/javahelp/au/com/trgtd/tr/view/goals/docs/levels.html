        <h2>Goal levels</h2>
        <p>
            The levels are used to classify your goals. Examples of levels are: 
            Life Purpose, 3 - 5 years goals, 1 - 2 year goals, short-term goals.
        </p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The data in this screen is displayed in a table. To navigate between rows,
            you can use the mouse or the arrows keys.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal levels Order</h3>
        <p>
            The order that the levels are entered is used in the combo list and when ordering goals.
            To change that order, drag and drop the level or use the Move Up and Move Down options
            (in the right-click popup menu). Note that sorting the table by clicking on a column
            header does not change the actual order of the levels.
        </p>
        <h3>Add goal level</h3>
        <p>
            Enter a new goal level using the <i>Add Goal levels</i> button. You can choose which 
            icon to use for the goals of that level. You can also specify whether projects can be
            associated to goals of that level and which fields should appear when entering goals
            for that level.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal level modification</h3>
        <p>
            To modify, navigate to the appropriate goal level and either use the <i>Edit</i> button, 
            or press Enter key or double click. The Edit Goal Level window opens and data can be modified.
            Press the OK button to save your changes and go back to the list. Press the Esc key or
            the CANCEL button to close the window and ignore any changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can delete a goal level by using the <i>Delete</i> button or the Delete key. A confirmation 
            is required. If the goal level has been associated to any goals, you cannot delete it.
