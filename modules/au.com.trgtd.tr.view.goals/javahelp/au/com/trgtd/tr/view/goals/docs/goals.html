        <h2>Review Goals</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        This screen is where you enter and maintain your goals and projects assigned to them. The hierarchy of goals and
        assigned projects is displayed in a tree format. When expanded the goal tree shows sub-goals under each goal.

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        To navigate in the goal tree, you can use the mouse or the up and down arrows keys.

        <h3>Goal Tree</h3>
        <b><i>Order</i></b><br>
        The goals are displayed in the order they were entered. You can change that order by:
        <ul>
            <li>
                selecting the goals or sub-goals and move them up and down using the Move operation;
            </li>
            <li>
                using the drag and drop functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b><i>Drag and Drop functionality</i></b><br>
        To move sub-goals to a different goal, you can drag and drop them using the mouse. You can also change a
        sub-goal to be a top goal by dragging it under the Goals node. Similarly, you can drag a goal under
        another goal, changing it to a sub-goal. If you drag a goal or sub-goal, all sub-goals are moved too.

        <h3>Goal Operations</h3>
        To perform all operations, you need to select the goal node and either use the right-click menu or the
        Shortcut Key assigned to the operation. You can also use the Add Goal, Edit Goal or Delete Goal buttons.
        <p>
            Except for Edit and Add goal, all other operations can be performed to more than one goal at the time. Just hold
            the Shift or Command key while selecting them.
        </p>
        <p>
        The following operations are possible:
        </p>
        <b><i>Edit</i></b><br>
        To modify a goal, navigate to the appropriate goal level and either use the <i>Edit</i> button, or press Enter.
        The Edit Goal window opens and data can be modified. Press the OK button to save your change and
        go back to the list. Press the Escape key or the CANCEL button to close the window and ignore any changes.
        <p>
            <b><i>Expand All/Collapse All: tree expansion</i></b><br>
            The goal/sub-goal expands and the subtasks are listed under the goal/sub-goal. You can expand
            all goals by selecting the top node &quot;goals&quot;. To perform the same operation, you can also
            click on the expansion symbol on the left of the goal node.
        </p>
        <b><i>Show/Hide Achieved</i></b><br>
        When you perform the Show Achieved operation, achieved goals for the selected node are shown as well
        as the no achieved ones. Perform Hide Achieved to only see the ones to be achieved.
        <p>
            <b><i>Add goal</i></b><br>
            The goal will be added within the goal previously selected. The Add Goal  window opens
            and data can be entered. The fields displayed correspond to the goal level selected. Press the OK button to save your entry and
            go back to the list. Press the Escape key or the CANCEL button to close the window and ignore any entries.
        </p>
        <p>
            A sub-goal created under an existing goal will take the level and topic of that goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Copy, Cut and Paste functionality</i></b><br>
            You can copy, cut and paste goals (and their sub-goals) to a different goal. You can also change a
            sub-goal to be a stand alone goal by cutting and pasting it under the goals node. Similarly,
            you can cut and paste a goal under another goal, changing it to a sub-goal. If you copy/cut and
            paste a goal or sub-goal, all sub-goals are copied/moved too.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Move goal</i></b><br>
            You can move a goal or sub-goal by selecting it and using this operation to move it up or down
            within the goal it is in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Other</i></b><br>
            Change Level: combo is displayed to select the new level. <br>
            Change Topic: combo is displayed to select the new topic. <br>

        <!--/ul-->
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        To get motivated to achieve a goal/sub-goal, the following fields (optional and displayed according to the level) should be thought of:
        Accountability, Brainstorming, Obstacles, Rewards, Support and Vision.
        <p>
            Please note that there are no limits to sub-goal nesting, i.e. a sub-goal can include sub-goals,
            etc. but it is recommended not to use more than a few levels.
        </p>

            </li>

        </ul>

        <h3><a name="projects"/>Assigning Projects to Goals</h3>
        <p>
            Projects can be assigned to goals where the goal level allows this 
            (i.e. the goal level has the <code>Goals have projects</code> option set).
        </p>
        <p>
            To view or change the projects assigned to goals, use the the <I>Show/Hide Projects</I> tool bar button or right-click menu option on
            a goal node.
        <p/>
        <p>
            When the <I>Projects</I> folder is displayed, you can then add a Project link using the <code>Add</code> right-click menu option on
            the folder. A pop-up window opens allowing you to choose a project to assign. More than one project can be linked to the same goal
            and a project can be linked to more than one goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Project to Goal Assignments can be removed using the <code>Delete</code> right-click menu option on the Project assignment node.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can go to an assigned project by using the <code>Edit</code> right-click menu option or by double-clicking on the project node.
        </p>
