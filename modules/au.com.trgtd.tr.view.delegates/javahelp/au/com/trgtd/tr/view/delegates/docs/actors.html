        <h2>Delegates</h2>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            This screen is used to keep and maintain your list of delegates.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can set a delegate to &quot;Inactive&quot; if no action can be delegated to it anymore, e.g. a team member leaving. TR will validate that there is no
            current actions delegated to the delegate.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can indicate that a delegate is part of a ThinkingRock team (Team member tick box).  In that case, additional action data (Topic, Due Date, Start Date, Successful Outcome, Priority, 
            Energy, Time and reference to the delegated action) will be added when sending an email to the delegate. When the delegate retrieves and processes the thought using their own ThinkingRock instance, this data will be populated 
            to the action panel. The delegate email address must be set to the same one the delegate uses to import thoughts through email.
        </p>

        <p> When you set-up a delegated action, the list of values for the Delegate To includes active delegates except if the action is done. 
            In that case, inactive delegates are also included but they are shown strikeout. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also create new delegate when you are setting up an action by using the &quot;Add new...&quot; value at the top of the list.
        </p>
        
        
        
        <p>If you need to tidy up your delegate values, use the Global Find function to update the actions.</p>
