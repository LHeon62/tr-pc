                    <i>If this option is checked you will be able to change the Created date field on action details panel.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Append note for delegated email</b>
                    <i>If this option is checked a note is appended to the action notes when the email button is activated on a delegated action.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Default delegate mode</b>
                    <i>This default mode is used when you creating a Delegated action. If you select Free text, you can directly enter a one-off delegate
                        in the Delegate To field. If you select Drop down list, you can directly select from the list. Whatever mode you select,
                    you are able to either enter Free text or select from the Delegates list.</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Initial action state field.</b> This option allows you to choose the initial action state (Inactive, Do ASAP,
                    Scheduled or Delegated) of new actions created using the Process Thoughts screen.
                </li>                
                <li>
                    <b>Email encoding</b>
                    <i>Select the character encoding to use when sending delegated emails. If your particular email client program does not
                        accept the delegation information passed to it from ThinkingRock, choosing an appropriate encoding here should fix the problem.
                    <b>On Linux, this option should be left as blank (the default value).</b></i>
                </li>
            </ul>
