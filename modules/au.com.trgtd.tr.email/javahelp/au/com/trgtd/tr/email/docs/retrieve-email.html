        <h2>Retrieve Email</h2>
        <p>
            This function retrieves email from the email account you have set-up under
            <a href="email-prefs.html">Email Preferences</a> and imports them into TR. Each email becomes a thought, with
            the description set to the subject of the email and the notes set to the body of the email. You can also
            set the preferences to save email attachments.
        </p>
        <p>
            When using this functionality with other TR team members, the following symbols might be prepended to the thought description:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>&#x261E; represents an action delegated to you</li>    
            <li>&#x261E; &#x2713; represents a delegated action response indicating the action has been done by the delegate</li>
            <li>&#x261E; &#x00D7; represents a delegated action response indicating that the action previously set to done by the delegate has now been set to not done (by the delegate)</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>
            Please note that this function does NOT work if you have a proxy server. This is a restriction due to JavaMail.
