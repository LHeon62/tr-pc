        <h2>Find</h2>
        <p>
            Enter the text you are looking for and press Enter or the OK button. The text is searched in the
            description and notes of actions, projects (current and future), unprocessed thoughts,
            reference items and someday/maybe items. The delegate of delegated actions is also searched.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can narrow your search by excluding done actions and projects or by searching on done actions and projects only.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results are listed in the following order: single actions, actions in projects, current projects,
            future actions, future projects, unprocessed thoughts, reference items and last someday/maybe items. An
            icon indicates the type. You can change this order by a single click on the column header of the find
            results window. Another click toggles the order to ascending/descending. To add more columns to
            the order, use Shift+single click.
        </p>
        <p>
            To view one the object found, select the view option on the right click menu. A shortcut key has been
            defined (Alt+V), which you can change through the Options/Keymap functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can minimise the Find window and view the results again by moving your mouse to the Find Window
            button (bottom left of the screen) or click that button.
