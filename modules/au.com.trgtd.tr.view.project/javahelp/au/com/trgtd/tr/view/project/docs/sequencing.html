        <h2>Automatic Sequencing</h2>
        <p>
            Within a project, in order to get an action set from Inactive to Do ASAP automatically when the previous Do ASAP action is set to
            done, you need to set the sequencing on at the project level. If the sequencing fields do not appear on
            the project details panel, please check your
            <a href="nbdocs://au.com.trgtd.tr.prefs.projects/au/com/trgtd/tr/prefs/projects/docs/projects-prefs.html">Project Preferences</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three options for automatic sequencing:
            <ul>
                <li>Include sub-projects: the sequencing will go into a sub-project to select the next action when the
                    action before the sub-project is set to done. For example: a user has a project with several actions that are sequenced and then a certain
                    action needs to be broken down into sub-tasks so the user converts the action to a sub-project. When the last action BEFORE the sub-project
                    is done, it will sequence INTO the sub-project. Similarly when the last action of a sub-project is set to done, it sequences onto the next higher
                level action or even into the next sub-project if it sits in sequence.</li>
                <li>Scheduled: if unchecked, scheduled actions will be ignored in sequencing.  Therefore, when a Do ASAP action is set to done, the next inactive action
                    is changed to Do ASAP even if there are scheduled actions.
                </li>
                <li>Delegated: if unchecked, delegated actions will be ignored in sequencing.  Therefore, when a Do ASAP action is set to done, the next inactive action
                    is changed to Do ASAP even if there are delegated actions.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a sub-project, the sequencing options of the parent project are used by default.
